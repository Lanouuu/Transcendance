				If you can read this stele, it means you used the Zaquel armillary sphere prototype.
				After its construction, we activated it, and everything disappeared: the lab, the sphere, my research team, except for my assistant, Iris, and the quartz crystal.<br><br>

				The sphere was miscalibrated on the fundamental network of events.
				We were transported to a parallel node of the network. Quartz technology is inoperative here. We'll have to find another solution.<br><br>

				We encountered a gothic fox ghost named Irkalla.
				Completely obnoxious, in my opinion, but Iris likes him.
				The quartz crystal has a strange effect on him, as if he was intimately linked to the network.<br><br>

				Iris showed him some games on her BlackBerry. Why the fuck are ghosts so obsessed by video games ?<br><br>

				During the night, I found a way to escape this parallel node.
				The quartz makes Irkalla uneasy because he's linked to the network by his inner chaos - it should not be possible. The quartz is too ordered, they are poles apart.
				By exciting him enough, he might be able to send us to another node where quartz technology will be usable.<br><br>

				It worked ! Iris managed to get out. I'm about to do the same.
				Dear future explorers, find Irkalla and give him video games. He's your only way out.<br><br>
