				When we used the <b>Zaquel armillary sphere prototype</b>, everything disappeared: the lab, the sphere and my team, except for my assistant, Iris, and the <b>quartz</b>.
				The sphere was miscalibrated on the fundamental network of events.
				We've been transported to a <b>parallel node</b> of the network.<br><br>

				We encountered a gothic fox ghost named <b>Irkalla</b>.
				Completely obnoxious, but Iris likes him.
				The quartz crystal has a strange effect on him.<br><br>

				Iris showed him some games on her BlackBerry. Why the fuck are ghosts so obsessed by <b>video games</b> ?<br><br>

				I found a way to escape this parallel node.
				The quartz makes Irkalla uneasy because he's linked to the network by his inner chaos - the quartz is too ordered, they are <b>poles apart</b>.
				By exciting him enough, he might be able to send us home.<br><br>

				<b>It worked !</b> Iris managed to get out. I'm about to do the same.
				Dear future explorers, find Irkalla and give him video games. <b>He's your only way out</b>.<br><br>
